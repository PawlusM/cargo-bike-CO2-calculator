# Cargo Bike CO2 Calculator

## Overview
The Cargo Bike CO2 Calculator project aims to provide a tool for comparing the CO2 emissions between using a cargo bike and an internal combustion van for transportation purposes. With the growing concerns about climate change and the environmental impact of transportation, this tool offers users a way to make more informed decisions about their transportation choices.

## Features
- **CO2 Emissions Calculation**: The core feature of this project is the ability to calculate and compare the CO2 emissions produced by using a cargo bike versus an internal combustion van for a given transportation network.
- **Input Parameters**: Users can input various parameters such as distance traveled, payload weight, fuel efficiency of the van, and other relevant factors to obtain accurate emission comparisons.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, allowing users to input their data quickly and obtain results efficiently.
- **Visualization**: The project will include visualization features to present the emission comparison results graphically, making it easier for users to interpret the data.
